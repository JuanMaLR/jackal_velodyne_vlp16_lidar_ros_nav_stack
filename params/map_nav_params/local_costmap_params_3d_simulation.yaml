#Local planner uses local costmap to calculate local plans
#Created directly from sensor readings 
#Depending on where on the map the robot is currently at that's the obstacle
#information that will be showed in RVIZ. This is due to the rolling window approach
#This optimizes computer resources 
#Local costmap detects new objects that appear in the simulation, global costmap don't
local_costmap:
   #Global frame for local costmap. Must be odom if no static map is used
   #map used in Jackal course
   global_frame: map #Default: odom

   #Make smaller because map is not too big and to save computer resources
   #Width of costmap
   width: 5.0 #Default: 10
   #Height of costmap
   height: 5.0 #Default:10
   resolution: 0.05
   #Deprecated
   #static_map: false
   #If set to false then the local costmap will be built from the static map and 
   #not the sensor's readings
