How to connect your computer to the jackal robot via Wifi:
1.- Connect to the power outlet the router and the profesor's computer.
2.- Connect via ethernet the profesor's computer and the router. 
	2a.- On the router connect to the internet port (blue one)
3.- Turn on the jackal and wait for the wifi icon to turn green.
4.- On your computer connect to the ROS_robot hotspot. The password is the same as the network name: ROS_robot
5.- Ping the jackal NIC's: ping 192.168.0.102
6.- If the pings were successful ssh into the jackal's computer using: ssh administrator@192.168.0.102
	6a.- The password is clearpath
7.- Update and upgrade the jackal ubuntu system: sudo apt-get update & upgrade
8.- Do the configurations required for your project.

For my LiDAR project:
1.- Download the pcl libraries required for compilation:
	1a. sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-pcl-conversions
	1b. sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-pcl-ros
2.- Under catkin_ws/src clone the github repository: git clone https://github.com/JuanMaLR/jackal_velodyne_vlp16_lidar_ros_nav_stack.git
3.- Change directory to catkin_ws/
4.- Compile the project: catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps jackal_velodyne_vlp16_lidar_ros_nav_stack
5.- Set the environment variables as specified in the repository readme.

For static transform publisher:
From the center of the jackal to the 2D LiDAR center:
- 16.5cm in positive x axis
- 15cm in positive z axis

Original frames in the jackal robot include a base_link, chassis_link, mid_mount and front_mount.
base_link to chassis_link suffers no translation 
chassis_link to mid_mount has a z translation of 0.184
mid_mount to front_mount has an x translation of 0.120
Then I can ignore the translation required for my 2D LiDAR

To visualize frames tree in the jackal:
rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
To copy the pdf into your computer do: scp administrator@192.168.0.102:frames.pdf .
