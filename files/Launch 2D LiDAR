Steps for launching 2D LiDAR on ROS (RPLiDAR A3 from SLAMTEC):
1.- Go to your src folder: cd catkin_ws/src
2.- Clone slamtec repo: git clone https://github.com/Slamtec/rplidar_ros
3.- Return to src folder: cd ..
4.- Source workspace: source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
5.- Build the repo: catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps rplidar_ros
6.- Connect using the USB cable your 2D LiDAR to your computer (only 1 cable needed, no need for the second one for power).
7.- Check to see that the device is recognized by your computer: lsusb 
	7a. In my case the device name was: Bus 003 Device 006: ID 10c4:ea60 Silicon Labs CP210x UART Bridge
8.- If the device appears set permisions to 777 on your USB port: sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
9.- Launch the rplidar_a3 launch file from the repo: roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar_a3.launch
10.- You should be able to visualize the scan topic in Rviz.
