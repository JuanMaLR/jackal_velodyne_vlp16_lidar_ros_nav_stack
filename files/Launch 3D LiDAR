Steps for launching 3D LiDAR on ROS (VLP-16 from Velodyne):
1.- Connect VLP16 LiDAR as explanined in the manual.
	1a. Connect LiDAR to interface card. 
	1b. Connect power plug to interface card.
	1c. Connect power to main line
	1d. Connect ethernet cable to interface card and computer
2.- Execute: sudo ip addr add 192.168.3.100 dev enx58ef68e40185 (substitute this last name for your ethernet interface name). 
	2a. Note: The command ip is new and is now the standard. If you're using ROS versions prior to noetic ifconfig is most likely the standard command for this so use: sudo ifconfig eht0 192.168.3.100
	2b. To configure the ethernet interface on the Jackal robot use the command sudo ifconfig enp3s0 192.168.3.100
	2c. Check references for pages where you can learn more about ip and ifconfig commands
3.- After assigning an ip to the ethernet port you can now execute: roslaunch velodyne_pointcloud VLP16_points.launch
	3a. To be able to do this you should have first installed ros dependencies for velodyne: sudo apt-get install ros-VERSION-velodyne
	3b. And also you need to download the drivers from github: cd ~/catkin_ws/src/ && git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne.git
	3c. Go to catkin_ws and run: rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro YOURDISTRO -y
	3d. Finally, build your project: cd ~/catkin_ws/ && catkin_make
		3d1. If you have more projects and you don't want to compile them all, then use: catkin_make --only-pkg-with-deps velodyne
4. This will generate a topic called: /velodyne_points
	4a. To visualize the output run rviz: rosrun rviz rviz
	4b. Select the fixed frame under global options to be velodyne
		4b1. If you can't find the frame, execute rosrun tf static_transform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 map velodyne 10 to make the connection
	4c. Add a PointCloud2 visualization and select the topic to be /velodyne_points
